# Glasslands docs

This folder is the design and technical reference for the project. It is written to stay aligned with what is in the repo, and to be specific enough that “next work” can be handed to Codex without re-litigating intent.

## Index

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - Current systems map (2D + 3D slices), determinism rules, and rendering notes.

- `SEEDS.md`
  - Seed charm format, current token behaviour, and the roadmap for richer seed semantics.

- `STORY.md`
  - The narrative premise, key nouns, and how the story is delivered in-game with minimal assets.

- `ROADMAP.md`
  - A performance-aware build plan: milestones that make the game feel like a game.

- `NARRATIVE_SYSTEM.md`
  - A concrete, low-overhead narrative delivery system (Echoes, Waystones, Journal).

## Ground rules

- Prefer meaning over decoration. New “things” should usually be systems and setpieces, not dense foliage.
- Every run should have a clear arc: drop in → gather → choose when to bank → dusk pressure → outcome.
- Keep determinism sacred. If a charm is shared, the world and narrative selection should be stable.
