# Glasslands — story

## North star

A broken sky is held together by memory trapped in glass. Speak a charm, enter a drifting shard, steal its light back from the dark, and stitch it into the Ring before the shard forgets you were ever there.

## Premise (short)

The Sky Ring once kept the world coherent: seasons, colour, even the way places “made sense”. When it shattered, the pieces did not fall. They drifted.

Each fragment became a pocket wilderness — a Glassland — that can only hold shape when it is named. A charm is not magic in the theatrical sense; it is a stabiliser. Words and symbols give a shard a pattern to follow, long enough to step inside.

Waystones are the last working parts of the Ring. They do one thing reliably: remember. Glass Beacons are scattered lenses inside each shard, still holding warmth from the old sky. Bring that warmth to a Waystone, and a little more of the Ring survives.

Dusk is the Hollow arriving: the slow, hungry force that erases unstable shards.

## Player role

The player is a Binder: someone who can “hold” a shard in place by naming it, and carry light through places that are trying to forget themselves.

The Binder is not a hero by strength. The fantasy is precision under pressure: quick reads, tight routes, knowing when to bank and when to push.

## Key nouns (diegetic vocabulary)

- Glassland: a drifting shard-biome that needs a name to stay coherent.
- Charm: the name that stabilises a Glassland (the player’s seed input).
- Glass Beacon: a lens that still contains stored sky-light.
- Waystone: an anchor that banks light and writes it into the Ring’s memory.
- The Hollow: the erasing pressure that arrives at Dusk.

## Run objective (what the player is doing)

- Drop into a Glassland from a charm.
- Collect Glass Beacons (light).
- Decide when to bank at the Waystone.
- Survive until banking, or lose what was not banked when Dusk arrives.

The run is short and repeatable. The meaning comes from what is banked and what is learned.

## How the story is delivered (minimal assets, high payoff)

The game avoids NPC crowds and object-heavy scenes. Story arrives in three lightweight channels:

1) Beacon Echoes
- Each collected beacon yields a one-line “echo” (memory fragment).
- Echo selection is deterministic per charm and run stage.

2) Waystone Transmissions
- Banking triggers a slightly longer message (2–4 lines).
- These messages confirm progress, tease the next thread, and give emotional weight to the run result.

3) The Journal
- The player can read collected Echoes in a quiet, text-first screen.
- The Journal groups Echoes by “Ring Shard” (milestone) so progress feels real.

## A more compelling arc (Acts)

Act I — The First Stitch
- The Binder learns that the Ring can still remember.
- Early Echoes are sensory: weather, colour, motion, a sense of loss.
- Milestone: first successful bank.

Act II — Names That Hold
- Echoes start forming patterns: repeated phrases, a missing name, a warning.
- The player learns the charm is not only shaping a biome; it is selecting which memory fragment can surface.
- Milestone: unlock “verbs” (run modifiers) as the Binder learns to steer shards more deliberately.

Act III — Teeth of the Hollow
- The Hollow becomes active pressure: harsher dusk, misdirection, and a clear antagonist force.
- Echoes reveal why the Ring broke (not an accident; a choice).
- Milestone: a “Ring Step” that feels like progress, not just score.

## Sample copy (short, British, in-game ready)

Prologue (first launch)
- “The Ring broke, and the sky learned to drift.”
- “A charm can hold a place still. Not for long.”
- “Bring the light to a Waystone. Let it remember.”

Beacon pickup (randomised)
- “Warmth, sealed in glass.”
- “A colour that no longer exists.”
- “Footsteps on a road that isn’t there.”
- “Someone laughing, far away, then cut short.”
- “A name half-spoken.”

Banking (Waystone)
- “Banked. The Ring takes note.”
- “Good. The Hollow hates a place that’s remembered.”
- “Another stitch. Keep moving.”

Dusk warning
- “Dusk is coming. The Hollow is near.”
- “Bank what you have, or carry it into nothing.”

Failure (dusk without banking)
- “Unbanked light scatters. The shard forgets.”
- “Try again. Say the charm like it matters.”

Postcard footer (optional)
- “A place held together by a name.”

## Tone rules

- Concrete, sensory writing beats abstract lore.
- Short lines. No invented technobabble.
- The story should feel like it belongs to the mechanics: banking is remembering; dusk is erasure.
