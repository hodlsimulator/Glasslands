# Glasslands — Story & Objective

## North Star (one-liner)
A pocket wilderness that rewrites itself from a seed charm. Relight its glass beacons and bank their light before the world shifts again.

## Premise (short)
Long ago the Sky Ring shattered, and the world splintered into wandering **glasslands** — pocket biomes that take shape from small charms (emoji and words). Each charm stabilises one of these places just long enough to explore. Within every glassland lie dim **Glass Beacons** and a lone **Waystone**. Relight the beacons and carry their light to the Waystone to mend a sliver of the Ring.

---

## Core Objective (per run)
- **Goal:** Collect as many **Glass Beacons** as possible and **bank** them at the **Waystone** before **Dusk**.
- **Loop:**  
  1) **Cast a Seed Charm** (pick 2–3 Genmoji or a short phrase).  
  2) **Drop In** to the generated glassland.  
  3) **Relight Beacons** by approaching them.  
  4) **Find the Waystone** and **Bank** to lock in the score.  
  5) **Mint a Postcard** (optional) and share the charm as a **Challenge**.

---

## Win / Fail
- **Win the run:** Reach the Waystone and bank before Dusk.  
- **Soft fail:** Dusk falls while unbanked → only the last banked total is kept (or zero if never banked).  
- **Leaderboards:** “Most Beacons Banked” and “Fastest First Bank”, with daily charm categories.

---

## Meta-Progression (lightweight, optional)
- **Mending the Ring:** Runs that bank ≥N beacons award a **Ring Shard**. Shards from any charms contribute to **Ring Steps** (cosmetic milestones: title cards, postcard frames, UI tints).

---

## World Bits (diegetic names)
- **Glass Beacons:** Small standing lenses that shimmer and hum when nearby.  
- **Waystone:** A tall prism that accepts beacon-light; it pulses brighter as the bearer approaches.  
- **Dusk:** A short countdown; sky warms, audio hushes, vignette grows.

---

## Acts (seasonal arcs, shippable as updates)
**Act I — “Light the Beacons”**  
- *Objective:* Bank 5 beacons on any charm.  
- *Tutorial beats:* Cast charm → move → collect a beacon → find the Waystone → bank.

**Act II — “Follow the Rivers”**  
- *Objective:* Bank a chain of beacons placed along riverbeds in one charm.

**Act III — “Ring Singer”**  
- *Objective:* Bank 10+ beacons on three unique charms to unlock a cosmetic “Sky Ring” postcard frame.

---

## Challenge Templates
1) **Daily Charm Sprint** — 3:00 timer, most beacons banked.  
2) **First Bank Race** — First to reach the Waystone and bank 3 beacons.  
3) **Cartographer** — Visit 3 map pins (simple set-pieces) then bank once.

## Minimal Tutorial Copy (on-screen, < 150 chars each)
- **“Relight the Glass Beacons”** — They shimmer; walk into them.  
- **“Find the Waystone”** — Bank to lock your score.  
- **“Dusk is coming”** — Bank before the light fades.  
- **“New Charm, New World”** — Change the seed any time.

## Sample In-Game Blurbs (short & British)
- *Prologue:* “The Ring broke. The lands wander. A charm holds a place still — just long enough to bring the light home.”  
- *Waystone:* “Banked. The Ring remembers.”  
- *Dusk:* “Light thins. Make for the stone.”
